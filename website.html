			<h1>A Little About Myself</h1>
			<p>I've had a passion for programming since I joined my high school's FIRST Robotics team as a freshman. When I joined, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do: I drifted between subteams, doing some pneumatics here, some metalworking there, but never doing anything that I found really engaging. Then one day, I went over to the programming subteam. I've been programming ever since.</p>
			<p>For me, every programming problem is like a jigsaw puzzle, a chance to use conditionals, libraries, and a pinch of creative thinking to assemble something far greater than the sum of the parts. </p>
